class Consumer:
    """
    Faktory Consumer (Worker).

    It fetches units of work (jobs) from the server and executes them.
    It retrieves the jobs from the queues, and decides how to execute them
    based on the jobtype.

    A handler must be attached to each jobtype before the consumer is launched.

    Parameters
    ----------
    client : pyfaktory.Client
        Faktory client. Client `role` must be either 'consumer' or 'both'.
    queues : List[str], default ['default']
        The queues from which the consumer will fetch jobs. If you provide
        no `queues`, the consumer will process `default` queue.
    priority : {{'strict', 'uniform', 'weighted'}}, default 'uniform'
        Priority indicates in which queue order the jobs should be fetched
        first. With `strict` priority, the worker always fetches from the first
        queue and will only try to fetch from the next once the previous queue
        is empty. With `uniform`, each queue has an equal chance of being
        fetched first. With `weighted`, queues have a different probability
        of being fetched. These probabilities are specified with `weights`
        argument.
    weights : Optional[List[float]], default None
        Probability of the queues to be fetched. This parameter is required
        when `priority` is `weighted` (and ignored in other cases), and must
        have the same number of elements as `queues`.
    concurrency : int, default 4
        Number of jobs to run at the same time.
    grace_period : int, default 25
        Grace period between the beginning of a shutdown and its end.
        This period is used to give the job some time to finish, to stop them
        properly and to notify the server. This period should never be longer
        than 30 seconds.
    sentry_capture_exception : bool, default False
        If `True` capture exceptions using Sentry before failling jobs.
